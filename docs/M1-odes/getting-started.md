# Mathematical models

Differential equations are the foundation of modern science. In this class, we'll approach the math gently, but we won't shy away from it either. In this section, we provide additional materials to help you familiarize yourself with or learn more about differential equations. Note that this section is intended to motivate you to learn about the topic. While these videos can help you gain some intuition, mathematics is fundamentally a know-how. To truly get it, you need to get your hands dirty.
