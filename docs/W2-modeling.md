## Modeling

<div class="callout">
  <h3>üí° Callback</h3>  
  <p>Last week, Lhd offers the following equalities in his video on modeling complex systems</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Modeling = Representing</li>
        <li>Complex = Inseperable</li>
        <li>Systems = Wholes</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>How do they encourage transdiscplinary research? How are they useful pillars to start a field? How can they be misleading? Do you remember what are the different features that came out of his examples of complex systems? How do they relate to these relationships</p>
</div>

Last week, we defined models and gave a few examples. We saw that defining models force us to make choice about what is being represented. This week, we start modeling:
