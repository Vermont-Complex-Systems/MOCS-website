    <p>Last week, Lhd offered the following equalities in his video on modeling complex systems</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Modeling = Representing</li>
          <li>Complex = Inseperable</li>
          <li>Systems = Wholes</li>
      </ul> 
      <p>How do they encourage transdiscplinary research? How are they useful pillars to start a field? How can they be misleading? Do you remember what are the different features that came out of his examples of complex systems? How do they relate to these relationships?</p>

Last week, we defined models as nouns. We saw that defining models forces us to make choices about what is being represented. This week, we start modeling (and philosophizing, just a little):

This clip is really about the different types of models. They are useful distinctions because you might want to choose one over another based on the problem at hand; engineers don't ignore the same details as mathematicians. In both cases, you are abstracting away details, but not in the same way. When you learn to categorize models, you are also building a shared vocabulary with your peers. This is the basis of effective communication with your peers.

Here is LHD's recipe for modeling complex systems
  
  - Whole
    - Space ${tex`\rightarrow`} discrete (network) or continuous (2D or 3D)
    - Time ${tex`\rightarrow`} discrete (rounds or generations) or continuous (clock)
    - Open or closed
  - Parts
    - What are the parts? (spatial scale)
      - People? Towns? Cells?
    - Wht distinguish the parts?
      - Sick/Healty? Dupped or not? Old healthy trees? etc
      - What do the parts know? 
        - is there memory?
    - How do they interact?
