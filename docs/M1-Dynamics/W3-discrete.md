    <p>We covered philosophy of (scientific) modeling and LHD's recipe for modeling. We distinguished between scale, analogical, idealized, and phenomenological models. Can you remember what is the difference between aristotelian and galilean idealized models? Why phenomenological models not understood as mecanistic models?</p>
    <br>
    <p>We then introduced compartment models by drawing diagrams. How do we distinguish the boxes from one another? What are the assumptions that go into building a models as boxes? What are we missing?</p>

This week, we convert last week's boxes into discrete dynamical equations that we can do maths and compute. We start by introducing the SIR model, and show how we can make it more heterogenous, e.g. different types of susceptibility, or recovered status (e.g. long lasting sickness, dead, recovered), do people are aware that they are contagious (asymptomatic), age groups, etc.
