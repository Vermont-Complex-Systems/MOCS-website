This week, we convert last week's boxes into discrete dynamical equations that we can do maths and compute. We start with the SIR model, and show how we can make it more heterogenous by introducing, for instance, different degrees of susceptibility, distinct removal status (e.g., long lasting sickness, dead, recovered), or infection awareness (e.g., asymptomatic).

In this video, LHD walkthroughs the SIS model and introduces the mean-field approximation:

We are now ready to convert the mathematics into code: 

<iframe src="https://streaming.uvm.edu/embed/49963/" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

As an example, LHD imagines a cloning factory as idealized through the diagram below: 

${mermaid`graph LR
      cIN --a (N->N+1)---> CloneFactory;
      CloneFactory --c (N->2N)---> CloneFactory;
      CloneFactory --l (N->N-1)---> cOUT;
      style cIN fill:#fff,stroke:#fff,color:#fff
      style cOUT fill:#fff,stroke:#fff,color:#fff
`}

where ${tex`c`} is the rate at which people clone themselves. Everyday, this factory ask you (weirdly enough) to follow this procedure:

```julia
# Julia code
for t=1:Î”t:T
  if rand() < a*Î”t
    N_t += 1         # 'arrivals' (people getting into the building)
  end
  for n=1:N_t 
    if rand() < l*Î”t
      N_t -= 1     # 'departures'  (people leaving it)
    else
      if rand() < c*Î”t
        N_t += 1       # 'cloning' (people cloning themselves)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

What if any of those transition probabilities (e.g., ${tex`a\cdot Î”t`}) gets larger than 1? That means the ${tex`Î”t`} you are using is too large and you need to take it smaller. For instance, if there are, on average, three people entering the building in a week and ${tex`Î”t`} stands for _one week_, then ${tex`a\cdot Î”t = 3/\textrm{week} \cdot \textrm{week} = 3 > 1`}. To solve the problem, take for example ${tex`Î”t = 1\textrm{day}`}, so that now ${tex`a = (3/7)/\textrm{day}`} and ${tex`a\cdot Î”t = (3/7)/\textrm{day} \cdot \textrm{day} = 3/7 < 1`}.

Also, order matters. We are testing departure first, assuming that people can replicate only if they didn't decided to leave the building. One could think of alternative situations where, during the same time step (which, remember, being finite allows for multiple processes along its duration), people first try to clone themselves and then consider to leave; or, where recently arrived people can replicate or leave only during the next time step (which would mean moving the `arrivals' code block at the end). 

There are more issues, that can be addressed by poisson processes 

<div class="def">
<h3>Poisson Processes</h3>
  Something happens at a given (fixed) rate, regardless of what happen beforehand.
</div>

Poisson processes can help fix two related problems, both happening when rates are high; (i) probability in any given step of something happening is smaller than one and (ii) when events happen at the same time (recovering and getting infected at the same time...).

The key idea from that video is that of renormalizing rates to make sure we handle correctly competing poisson processes. Say people can clone themselves every day:

```tex
\ell \Delta t \quad \text{(leaving first step)}\\ 
(1-\ell \Delta t)\ell \Delta t \quad \text{(leaving second step)}
```

We renormalize by ${tex`\Delta \tilde{t} = \Delta t / 2`}, or cutting the day in half.

```tex
\Delta t = \ell \frac{\Delta t}{2} + (1-\ell \frac{\Delta t}{2})\ell \frac{\Delta t}{2} = \ell \Delta t - \Big(\frac{\ell \Delta T}{2}\Big )^2 \quad \text{(leaving first step)} 
```

Now, for the chance of leaving on the second step

```tex
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \Delta t &= \Big(1 - \ell \frac{\Delta t}{2} \Big)^2 \cdot \ell \frac{\Delta t}{2} +
                  \Big(1 - \ell \frac{\Delta t}{2} \Big)^3 \cdot \ell \frac{\Delta t}{2} \\ 
            &= \ell \frac{\Delta t}{2} + 
                \ell \frac{\Delta t}{2}\quad -
                \Big(\ell \frac{\Delta t}{2} \Big)^2 -
                \Big(\ell \frac{\Delta t}{2} \Big)^2 + O(\ell \Delta t^3)
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
```

...

> Rate of a sum of poisson processes is the sum of rates!

Probability of poisson process ${tex`\lambda_1`} occuring before poisson process ${tex`{\lambda_2}`}

```tex
\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2}
```
