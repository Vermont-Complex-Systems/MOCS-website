    <p>Last week we saw how to formalize (in the simplest possible way) our modeling choices in the form of difference equations. Thinking of a system's evolution in discrete time is generally easier, which helps to formalize it. Also, the finite resolution with which we observe or measure a system in reality makes data discrete and thus more promptly interpreted via a discrete-time formulation. However, a finite time step allows multiple processes to occur simultaneously, and we showed how this can lead to incompatible events which, to be avoided, require us to force a certain temporal ordering.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We showed through an example how, thanks to infinitesimal time steps allowing for only one event at a time, continuous-time models solve that problem by construction. In particular, we introduced Poisson processes, a basic type of stochastic process, essential to model systems in virtually any field.</p>

This week, we first show how to go from a discrete-time to a continuous-time formulation of a model, namely, from difference to differential equations. We will get used to continuous-time models by building and analyzing a few of them. We will then learn how to integrate differential equations in a computer and eventually how to simulate a dynamics unfolding in continuous time.

In the next clip, LHD shows the transition from discrete to continuous time using the SIS model.
