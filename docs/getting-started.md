# Getting started

How is this website organized?
- You can find a bibliography in [here](./refs). 
- You will find extra ressources for computer sciency stuff (Github, Python, Julia, etc) in [here](./extra-ressources). For each module, we put some videos and introductory readings on the module's getting started page.
